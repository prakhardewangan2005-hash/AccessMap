# AccessMap — Step-Free Navigation

Accessibility-first routing concept focused on clarity, trust cues, and real-world constraints.

## Why it matters 
- **Core experience design:** Search → route options → step-free filters → guidance (state-ready UI)
- **Customer outcomes (VOC):** Decision clarity with trust cues (what to expect + fallback options)
- **Future-lab mindset:** Scalable accessibility taxonomy + constraints → documented insights (not just demos)



## Highlights
- Tradeoffs captured: **accuracy vs detours vs interaction cost**
- Edge cases covered: **missing data, elevator outages, steep slopes**
- Outputs: **flows/IA, interaction states, hi-fi prototype, walkthrough-ready narrative**
