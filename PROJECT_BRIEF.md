# PROJECT BRIEF — AccessMap

## Problem
Accessibility information in navigation is often incomplete or unreliable, causing uncertainty and mid-route failures (stairs, elevator dependency, steep segments).

## Users
- Wheelchair users / mobility limitations
- Seniors
- Temporary injuries
- Travelers with luggage/strollers

## Goal
Make step-free navigation **decision-friendly** using clear accessibility signals + trust cues + fallback options.

## Constraints (real-world)
- Missing/inconsistent data
- Elevator outages / temporary closures
- Tradeoff: accuracy vs detours vs interaction cost

## Success Metrics (proxy)
- Faster time-to-decision
- Fewer route abandons due to surprises
- Higher comprehension of accessibility labels
